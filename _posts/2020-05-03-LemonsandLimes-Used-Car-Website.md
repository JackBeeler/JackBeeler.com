# LemonsandLimes Website![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackBeeler/CSE4550-GroupProject/main/lemonsAndLimesAutoDealerLogo.png)

 [Lemons&Limes](https://lemonsandlimes.herokuapp.com/) is a mock used car dealer inventory website created during my software engineering class at CSUSB with a team of 7 members over a 10 week period. The team comprised of 5 software engineers, one assistant project manager, and myself the project manager.

Visiting users are able to view the company's current inventory, make user accounts to save vehicles, view the current staff, as well as contact the dealer. Employees can do the same but also have the ability to edit/add vehicles to the database.

Making this website was a fun and rewarding experience. During the process of making the website we also created SPMP (software project  management plan) as well as a SRS document to give to the pretend client (the professor in this case). 

The software development lifecycle used was an Agile Scrum methodology. As the project manager I also held weekly scrum meetings (outside of the twice a week class meetings) to talk to each team member.
